. In this module, we will explore our environments and get ready to install the Containerized version of AAP2 (Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2).

== Lab Goals

NOTE: Does this belong in the lab goals or the lab description?  

* Install the Containerized version of AAP2
** Automation Hub
** Event Driven Automation
** Postgres
* Become familiar with different deployment options
* Configure AAP2 Containerized
* Explore the AAP2 Containerized environment
** Storage 
** Logs
** Troubleshooting


== Lab Topology

// TODO: Add diagram

 image::images/..png[Lab Topology,align="center",width="100%"]

  * `bastion` - the terminals to your right are connected to this host via ssh as the `devops` user.
  ** This host is where you will be primarily working from.
  * The AAP2 Hosts
  ** `aap2`

  NOTE: All instances are running RHEL 9.3 and are sized appropriately for the lab.

== Explore your environment

Several artifacts and tools have been installed for you. Let's take a look at what is available.

NOTE: In the unlikey event that you see any failures, please ask for assistance.

== Optional: Customization your Environment

Your environment is now ready for you to customize, if there are tools and editors you prefer or shell settings, exports etc you would like to make.
The lab will take approximately 60-90 minutes and. You can add your favorite tools, aliases, etc. to make your environment your own.
+

| NOTE: Now is a great time to add any of your favorite tools `ripgrep`, `neovim` etc. You may also want to consider adjusting your environment to your taste or perhaps your `~/.vimrc`, ~/.bashrc` etc. You'll be on this host for 90 minutes so take a moment to make it your own.

. First, we will get our Ansible environment set up.

As you watch the airport, you might notice that really what we're doing is where unpackaging I'm at sport collection that contains the controller installer and other collections. Then near the end, you may notice that the bundle extracts a number of compressed container images and this is primarily because the controller installer will use these images to deploy the controller and the hub.
