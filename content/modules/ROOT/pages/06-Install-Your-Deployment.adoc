icon:clock-o[Duration: 10 Minutes] Duration: 10 minutes

Finally time to run the installer though the actual configuration steps in the prior 2 modules were quite light.

[NOTE]
====
This lab comes with 2 terminals so you can launch the installer in one terminal and keep an eye on the output whilst using the other to explore the processes and directory structures being deployed on the Containerized AAP2 host, reachable via `ssh aap2`

== Installation

. Ensure you are in the bundled installer directory

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd ~/ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-2.4-1-x86_64
----

. Ensure your ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH is set correctly
+
[NOTE]
====
By default `ansible` would not be able to find the collections inside the bundled installer, hence the need to set this explicitly.
